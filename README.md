# Neural Network notebooks for DTU course 10316

These notebooks are used in course 10316, Wednesday afternoon in week 2.  They are placed on github to make it easy to import them to Google Colab.

Anybody not following the course are still welcome to use them (in the unlikely case you find them useful).  Do with them as you will.
